;; (total-value pricelist numlist) produces the total value of items
;; with prices in pricelist and numbers in numlist.
;; total-value: (listof Num) (listof Nat) â†’ Num
;; requires:
;;         Values in pricelist >= 0
;;         pricelist and numlist have the same length
;; Examples:
(check-expect (total-value empty empty) 0)
(check-expect (total-value (list 2) (list 3)) 6)
(check-expect (total-value (list 2 3) (list 4 5)) 23)
