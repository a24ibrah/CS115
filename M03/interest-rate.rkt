;;Some banks pay different levels of interest for saving accounts.
;;The more a customer deposits, the more the bank pays.

;;In such arrangements, the interest rate depends on the interval into which
;;the savings amount falls.

;;To assist their bank clerks, banks use interest-rate function.

;;An interest function consumes the amount (amount) that a customer wishes
;;to deposit and responds with the interest that the customer receives
;;for this amount of money.

;; 0 <= amount <= 1000
;; 1000 < amount <= 5000
;; 5000 < amount
